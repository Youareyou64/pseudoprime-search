# Pseudoprime Searcher

## What?

This is a simple Python program that searches for pseudoprimes, specifically those that are exceptions to the theory stating that if $$2^n - 2$$ **is divisible by *n***, then n is prime. As this program makes clear, there are many exceptions to this "rule" (an infinite amount of them, in fact). 

## Why?
**Because why not?**
Ultimately, the goal here is to analyze the data for any identifiable patterns or to compare with other pseudoprime sets; but it's also just cool.

## How?
Very inefficiently. It's slow once the numbers get high. I know. If I can fix this, please let me know.

If you want to run this program yourself not in an IDE, I'd suggest commenting out all of the print statements and just using the optional txt file log feature.
